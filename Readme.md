# Next.js Portfolio Skeleton

This repository contains a minimal portfolio site built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.

The app lives in the `nextjs-portfolio` directory and was generated following the instructions from the user request. All pages are located under `src/app` with a simple responsive navigation bar.

To run the project locally, install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

*Note: network access is required to install packages.*
